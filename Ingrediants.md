# Special-Sandwich

    i have highlighted important things by using <>.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------<Ingrediants List>---------------------------------------------------
Following are the ingrediants required to make this sandwhich: -
1) Bread (I suggest 6 slices for 3 sandwiches)
2) Cream cheese <and> Cheese <block> (I porsonally like mozzarella blocks. Also, the slices just arent good for this sandwhich, so you need a cheese block)
3) Mayonaise (Any one is fine, depends on your taste)
4) Onions (The number onions depends on the size of the onion and the number of sandwhiches)
5) Oregano (Optional, but i still like it)
6) Extra salt if that is your taste (I like extra salt).

And thats it.
