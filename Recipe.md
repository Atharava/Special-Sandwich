                                                                          <Preparation>
<Step 1>: Start by grating the cheese block into a qauterplate (Its not compolsory to follow exact specifications on the quantity, it depends on how much you want).

<Step 2>: Start heating up your pan on the stove.

<Step 3>: While the pan is heating up, chop your capsicup into tiny pebble sized peices. This is because the capsicum should be chewy when you take a bite from the sandwhich ,but at the same time small enough so that there are no hard chunks in the sandwhich.

<step 4>: Chop your onion(s) into small pieces and saute them on the now hot pan with a little oil until they are brown in color.

<step 5>: Empty the pan (try to separate the onions from the oil) into a bowl.

<step 6>: Fill 1/3 of the bowl (Again, the amount depends on the size of your bowl, I usually use a bowl that is the size of my palm) with mayonaise, cream cheese and sprinkle the extra salt and oregano (both of which are optional) into the bowl and start mixing with a spoon.
                                                                            <Assembly>

<step 7>: (This is for one sandwhich) Take two slices of bread and on one of them spread the onion-mayo-creamCheese mixture evenly.

<step 8>: On the same slice of bread start sprinkling the grated cheese.

<step 9>: Again, on the same slice of bread, start sprinkling the bits of capsicum.

<step 10>: Top it off with another slice of bread and pressed down on the sandwich to compress it (It will make it easier to flip the sandwhich and melt the cheese). This will finnish the assembly.
                                                                             <Cooking>

<step 11>: Start heating up the same pan on the stove.

<step 12>: Pour some oil on it to lubricate the surface.

<step 13>: Carefully place the sandwhich on the hot pan.

<step 14>: Once one side of the sandwhich is covered with a thin layer of oil, then immediately flip it to cover the other side with a thin layer of oil. (This gives the bread a nice brown texture and keeps it from burning for a little while)

<step 15>: Keep flipping the sandwhich every 10 seconds or so until, each side has a beautiful brown texture. Thats when you know the sandwhich is ready.

<Repeat these cooking steps for however many sandwhiches you are making.>
<Enjoy!>
